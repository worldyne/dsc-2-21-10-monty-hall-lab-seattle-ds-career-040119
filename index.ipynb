    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab requires you to deal with one of the popular probability problems. i.e. the Monty Hall Problem. Do some quick background search about Monty Hall and his quiz show to see how this problem came about. Here we shall quickly introduce the problem and take you through a series of exercises towards its solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and describe the Monty Hall problem in probabilistic terms\n",
    "* Solve the Monty Hall problem using Bayesian Logic and mathematical manipulations\n",
    "* Run a simulation to find the optimal answer for the problem, and check if it matches your calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You are on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors.  Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is it to your advantage to change your choice , or would you rather stick with your initial choice?\n",

    "This is a classical probability problem and shown here in the simplest form. Wikipedia maintains an excellent document on this problem , explanations and solutions presented, along with a critique of approaches. [Visit think link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) and have a quick read through introduction part to understand why this is such a popular puzzle to solve. \n",

Let $D_i$ be the event that the car is actually behind door $i$.  Let $H$ be the event that Monty opens door number 3. First, compute $P(H \\mid D_i)$ for $i=1,2,3$.  You'll need to think carefully about the particular situation described above."
